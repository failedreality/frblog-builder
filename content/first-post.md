Like the title says, where to start.  I have had a decent IT career at this point.
I have had the opportunity to work on some big vendor technologies over the years and
very thankful for that.  Technologies and vendors include, VMWare, EMC, Dell, HP, ranging
from blade servers to clustered high available SQL Servers.  Internal VMWare infrastructure 
utilising vSan to flash array storage attached by fiber.
